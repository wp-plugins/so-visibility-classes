msgid "Although possible, <strong>I strongly discourage</strong> using the classes with images. The reason is that the SO Visibility Classes plugin only uses media queries with <code>display: block;</code> and <code>display: none;</code>. If you were to add a large image to only show on large screens, a medium image to show on tablets and a small image to show on smart phones, then the person visiting your site using a phone has to download all 3 images, which can have a major impact on the data plan of the visitor!"
